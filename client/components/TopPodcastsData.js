      'Money. Romance. Tragedy. Deception. The story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos is an unbelievable tale of ambition and fame gone terribly wrong. How did the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire lose it all in the blink of an eye? How did the woman once heralded as “the next Steve Jobs” find herself facing criminal charges — to which she pleaded not guilty — and up to decades in prison? How did her technology, meant to revolutionize health care, potentially put millions of patients at risk? And how did so many smart people get it so wrong along the way? ABC News chief business, technology and economics correspondent Rebecca Jarvis, along with producers Taylor Dunn and Victoria Thompson, take listeners on a journey that includes a multi-year investigation. You\'ll hear exclusive interviews with former employees, investors, and patients, and for the first-time, the never-before-aired deposition testimony of Elizabeth Holmes, and those at the center of this story.  In a series of new episodes, "The Dropout: Elizabeth Holmes on Trial" goes inside the courtroom, breaking down the evidence and keeping score for both sides as 12 jurors decide the fate of the Theranos founder and new mother. Three years after she was first charged, we find out how this saga finally ends.',

The plot has a code name: Operation Trojan Horse. The story soon explodes in the news and kicks off a national panic. By the time it all dies down, the government has launched multiple investigations, beefed up the country’s counterterrorism policy, revamped schools and banned people from education for the rest of their lives.   To Hamza Syed, who is watching the scandal unfold in his city, the whole thing seemed … off. Because through all the official inquiries and heated speeches in Parliament, no one has ever bothered to answer a basic question: Who wrote the letter? And why? The night before Hamza is to start journalism school, he has a chance meeting in Birmingham with the reporter Brian Reed, the host of the hit podcast S-Town. Together they team up to investigate: Who wrote the Trojan Horse letter? They quickly discover that it’s a question people in power do not want them asking.   From Serial Productions and The New York Times comes The Trojan Horse Affair: a mystery in eight parts.",

I watched in awe from my home while this simple phrase from Untamed – WE CAN DO HARD THINGS – the mantra that saved my life twenty years ago, became a worldwide rally cry. Because we experienced the hardship of the pandemic collectively, many of us finally acknowledged what was true before COVID and will be true after: That life is freaking HARD. We are all doing hard things every single day – things like loving and losing caring for children and parents; forging and ending friendships; battling addiction, illness, and loneliness; struggling in our jobs, our marriages, and our divorces; setting boundaries; and fighting for equality, purpose, freedom, joy, and peace. On We Can Do Hard Things, my sister Amanda and I will do the only thing I’ve found that has ever made life easier: We will drop the fake and talk honestly about the hard. Each week we will bring our hard to you and we will ask you to bring your hard to us and we will do what we were all meant to do down here: Help each other carry the hard so we can all live a little bit lighter and braver, more free and less alone.",

After more than a dozen conversations with guests like Stephen Colbert, Monica Lewinsky, Jia Tolentino, and Roxane Gay, it’s clear that people want these conversations to continue – that they’re interested in figuring out how we can regain control over our chaotic, hyperconnected world. That’s why Offline is here to stay. In the coming months, Jon will dig deeper into the internet abyss and beyond, exploring new topics with new guests from the worlds of news, politics, entertainment, sports, business, and more. Join Jon each week as he asks us to put down our screens, grab our headphones, and figure out how to live happier, healthier lives, both on and offline.",

Each week Peloton Instructor, athlete, author & host Tunde Oyeneyin will sit down with some of the most interesting experts and personalities from the world of fitness and beyond (Olympians! Musicians! Sociologists! Comedians! Actors!) to challenge and transform some of our own ideas about health, strength and mental wellness, and maybe even ourselves. What does it really mean to be strong? Does competition actually have anything to do with winning? Is the most important thing about pushing hard actually rest?

    showDescription:
      'On The DarkHorse Podcast, we will explore questions that matter, with tools that work. Weekly episodes of "The Evolutionary Lens" are co-hosted with Heather Heying, in which we use an evolutionary toolkit to reveal patterns in nature--including human nature. Other episodes will feature Bret hosting long form discussions. Some guests will be well known, others obscure, but all of them are chosen because they have demonstrated unusual insight. The state and future of civilization will be a recurring theme, so buckle up!',
